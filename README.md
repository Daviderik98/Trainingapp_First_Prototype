# Trainingapp_First_Prototype

This is my Final Project : A Training App, meant to help the user to plan a singular Strength workout session. It does this by letting the user answer 2 questions, how long the training should last, and at what level out of 3 options ("Active", "Challenging", and "Pushing my Limits") the training should be. Then the app will give the instructions : Do x many exercises and perform y many repetitions, rest for z long in between sets. The variables z y and z will have different values based on how the user answered the 2 questions at the start. 

The user can then select a variety of exercises from a big list, and add them, one at a time to a new list. That makes sure the user has enough exercises t perform in the workout. 

When it comes to components I have not used very many different ones. I could never get the Navigation to work, or Custom Components, so I had to work in one singular App.js-file. I also started working on the app very early, and there was still much we hadnÂ´t learned by then. Instead of the Navigation I used switch-cases for one variable that I could manipulate the state to on any buttonpress. I was also very reliant on other state-variables in the code. 2 arrays were used for the lists of exercises and Flatlist to print them out.  

When I was styling I wanted some good color-mix but not too mixed, to make the colors on all different screens distinct enough but also consistent. And then, I threw in an ImageBackground at the end, of me working out.
